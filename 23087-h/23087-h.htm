the present political situation, the price

<p>Attempts are now being made to
establish penny postage between England
and France. The Germans are
said to feel flattered that we should
still consider the privilege of corresponding
with them worth two-pence-halfpenny.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The public indignation against the
woman who damaged the "Rokeby
Venus" continues unabated, and most
inhuman propositions are being made.
One gentleman has even been heard to
suggest that the woman ought to be
made to serve her term of imprisonment
in the Royal Academy.</p>

<p>General <span class="sc">Villa's</span> statement that, unless
the ransom he demands is paid at
once, he will expose the body of the
son of General <span class="sc">Terrazas</span> to the fire of
the Federals confirms the opinion
prevalent in this country that General
<span class="sc">Villa</span> is not really a very nice man.</p>

this execution had taken place, some
time since in Mexico, for Justice has
not been seen there for a long time.</p>

<p>The yearly volume of judicial statistics
just issued shows a marked decrease
in business in all the courts except the
Divorce Court; and there is some talk
of the legal profession erecting a statue
of a co-respondent as a mark of their
appreciation.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Persons who like to be seen reading
a two-penny newspaper are now in a
quandary since the price of <i>The Times</i>
has been reduced, and it is again
rumoured that, in order to cater for
this class, an unsuccessful halfpenny
paper is about to raise its price to
twopence.</p>

<p>Sussex has been suffering from an
epidemic of sheep-stealing. The police
theory is that the sheep are carried off
at night in motor cars&mdash;the silly
creatures, accepting with alacrity the
novel offer of a ride in an automobile.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Several prominent authors having
stated that their best ideas come to
them while taking a tub, quite a
number of unsuccessful scribes have,
we hear, almost made up their minds
to the experiment of one bath a week.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In an Introductory Note to the serial
publication of <i>The Woman Thou Gavest
Me</i>, entitled "Why I wrote the Story,"
the Master attempts to shift the
blame&mdash;or, anyhow, to apportion the
responsibility. One day, it seems, Mr.
<span class="sc">Caine</span> heard the story which forms the
basis of the novel. He first told it to
a Cabinet Minister, who was "visibly
touched." He next tried it on a tailor,
who was "just as obviously affected."
Then comes this delicious passage:&mdash;"After
that I called on my publisher
and, not being able to get the story
out of my thoughts, I told it to him as
well. His eyes filled, his head dropped,
and he was as deeply touched as I and
the tailor and the Cabinet Minister
had been." It is generally understood
that Mr. <span class="sc">Heinemann</span> has since had a
complete recovery.</p>

<h2>THE HAT.</h2>

<p>"Of course," said the lady of the house, "you can turn
yourself into a hermit if you like. We'll build you a little
cell, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" I said. "A real hermit, in a long robe like a
bath-gown? With a real cell, and a dish of herbs on a
plain deal table, and some rocks to sleep on, and a folio
volume always open at the same place? May I really be
like that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "that's what you're coming to. And
there'll be a notice stuck up on a tree&mdash;'This way to the
Hermit,' with a painted hand."</p>

<p>"I know the sort," I said. "A hand with only one
finger."</p>

<p>"Yes, one finger pointing in the direction of the cell.
And all the village children will follow you when you go
out, and you'll threaten them with a gnarled stick, and
you'll be indicted as a nuisance."</p>

<p>"But not for a long time," I said.  "I shall have lots of
good hermiting before that happens. I shall have my
breakfasts quite alone and nobody will ask me to go to
Mrs. Latimer's musical afternoon in London, 4 to 7."</p>

<p>"Well, you're not a hermit yet, so you'll have to come
to Mrs. Latimer's with me. You know you'll enjoy it
when you get there."</p>

<p>"I won't."</p>

<p>"And you'll meet plenty of your friends."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to meet my friends," I said. "Friends
are people yon go on being friends with without meeting
them. That's the essence of true friendship, you know.
Absence doesn't alter it. You keep on thinking of dear old
Jack and what fun you used to have together at Cambridge;
and then some day a funny old gentleman comes up to you
in the street and says you don't remember him, and you
pretend you know him quite well, and it's Jack all the
time, and you wonder how he's got so old while you
yourself have kept on being as young as ever. That's
friendship."</p>

<p>"This," she said, "is not an Essay Club."</p>

<p>"What should a woman know of friendship?" I said
bitterly. "Besides, I shall have to get a new top-hat."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "there's nothing so very awful in that.
But what's the matter with the old one?"</p>

<p>"The old one," I said, "is a blacked sepulchre, and even
the black part of it is not very good. The lining is of the
sort that makes it necessary to place it on a table with the
opening down. Fortunate woman, your hats require no
lining and you don't take them off. You cannot sympathise
with my feelings. Such a top-hat as mine is good enough
for a Board meeting, but it cannot go to Mrs. Latimer's
musical afternoon. Her footman would despise me."</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, "get your new hat and have it
ready for this day fortnight."</p>

<p>The upshot of this conversation was that on the following
day I went to London, wearing my old top-hat, and called
at Messrs. Hutchfield's, the famous hatters. It is not a
very large shop, but it is very high, and something like
a million white hat-boxes, each presumably containing a
hat, are stacked in gleaming tiers from floor to ceiling.
The higher ones are fetched down by means of a long pole
provided at one end with a sort of inverted hook. It is a
most dexterous and pleasing trick, only to be attempted by
an old hand. An inexperienced practitioner would certainly
bring down an avalanche of hat-boxes on the heads of the
customers. On one side of the room there is a patent stove
in which several irons were heating, not for torture, but for
the improvement of hats. Several aproned attendants were
bustling about, and one or two customers with bare heads
were eyeing one another with an exaggerated air of haughty
nonchalance, as who should say, "Observe, we do not wear
white aprons. We do not <i>belong</i> to the shop. We are
genuine customers. We are waiting for our hats."</p>

<p>"Good morning," I said.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Sir," said one of the attendants; "what
would you be requiring to-day?"</p>

<p>"I think," I said, "it was a hat. Yes, I'm sure it was.
A top-hat, you know&mdash;one of your best."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Sir." With a graceful and airy movement
he whisked off my old hat and took its measure in length
and breadth.</p>

<p>"You mustn't draw any inference from the lining," I
said. "I'm not really as poor as all that. I've meant to
have it re-lined several times, but somehow I never brought
it off. Still, it's been a good hat."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Could it be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Sir, we could re-line it for you and make it
look almost as good as new."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" I cried. "Then I shan't want a new one,
shall I?"</p>

<p>"Well, Sir, it would take some little time. You would
want to wear something to go on with till it's finished."</p>

<p>"There is," I said, "some force in that. Put the machine
on me at once."</p>

<p>"The what, Sir?"</p>

<p>"The machine," I said. "The beautifully contrived,
apparatus made of ever so many wooden keys like the
inside of a piano&mdash;only those are set in circles. It fits
close to the head and you can make it looser or tighter,
and when you've got it on you look like a Siamese king
in his crown. And when you take it off you tear out a
piece of paper and that gives you the exact measure to a
hair's-breadth. Come, I'm ready."</p>

<p>His face relaxed into a serious kind of smile.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said, "you shall have it on, Sir, if you
like. But I thought, being an old customer and your
measure being known, it might not be necessary."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, "I'll give up the machine, but I
don't see how I can take any further pleasure in this
purchase. Still, if you know me so well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We don't forget customers of thirty years' standing,"
he said proudly.</p>

<p>"That settles it," I said. "I will now buy four hats&mdash;a
top-hat, a bowler, a soft felt and a straw hat."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," he said, and from an upper tier he extracted
a hat-box out of which he shortly produced a top-hat and
placed it on my head. It did not fit at first, but fire soon
reduced it to obedience.</p>

<p>"The others must be similarly treated," I said as I left
the shop.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in the interval it had begun to rain and
every taxi seemed to be taken. You know what a new
top-hat looks like after that. However, with two hats to
choose from, I am now ready to face Mrs. Latimer's
footman.</p>

<h2>OUR NEW PENNY PAPER.</h2>

<p>Thanks to Sir <span class="sc">Edward Carson</span>&mdash;or,
as <i>The Times</i> prefers to put it, "the
grave importance of the present political
situation"&mdash;the price of <i>The Times</i> has
fallen to one penny.</p>

<p>While it must be admitted that the
famous journal is well worth a penny,
we think it only fair to say that certain
issues of <i>The Daily Mail</i> and <i>Evening
News</i> last week, whose amazing editorial
organisations were so freely and
disinterestedly engaged in overcoming
colossal obstacles in order to give
information about the approaching
revolution, were worth anything from
fourpence to ninepence apiece.</p>

<p>If these philanthropic journals had
not been behind <i>The Times</i> last week,
what might we not have missed? Who,
for instance, would have learned that;
"the price (2<i>d.</i>) ... was equivalent to
that of one penny paper and two halfpenny
papers <i>per diem</i>"? We have
checked that statement, with the aid of
a ready-reckoner and a Latin dictionary,
and we find it substantially correct.
We are also able to agree to the further
statement made last Thursday, that
"from Monday next <i>The Times</i>, together
with any one of the halfpenny
morning papers, will be obtainable for
less than the present price of <i>The Times</i>
alone." If the mathematician who dug
up that fact had said "evening" instead
of "morning" his statement, curiously
enough, would still have been right.</p>

<p>Thanks to the reminder from <i>The
Evening News</i> that first numbers had
been known to become valuable, fetching
from &pound;10 to &pound;100, some 27,000 people
put aside nice clean copies of <i>The Times</i>
on Monday, in the hope of selling them
at a profit of about 24,000 per cent,
in 1964.</p>

<p>The greatest achievement in the
annals of journalism was of course <i>The
Daily Mail</i> man's successful attempt
to interview the publisher of <i>The Times</i>.
How he managed it we cannot think;
but we are very, very grateful to him.
We may add that ours is the only
journal that has succeeded in interviewing
the intrepid reporter. "How
did you contrive to force your way
through the seething mass in Printing
House Square, and pass the closely-guarded
portals of the world's chief
and largest newspaper office; and by
what means did you persuade the
Colossus of publishing to tell you anything
about it?" we asked. We regret
that we cannot give his reply; only
the incomparable genius of the painter
of <i>La Gioconda</i> could do that.</p>

<p>A curious incident took place outside
the Mansion House on Monday. In
the Agony Column of a famous two-penny
newspaper on Saturday the
following announcement had appeared:
"Will wate f. u. outsd. Mansn. Hs.
10-11 Mon. morn. Carry cop. <i>Times</i>
so I may no its u." A frantic lady
rushed at so many young and middle-aged
men, exclaiming, "Horace! at last
we meet!" that long before 10.30 it
was necessary for a kindly City policeman
to lead her away to a neighbouring
chemist's for first aid.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote><p>
"The fact that to-day is the 104th anniversary
of the birth of Mr. Gladstone prompts
reflection as to the different ways in which
their birthdays have been regarded by some
famous men."&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Writer (as he finishes)</i>: "Got it in
at last, thank Heaven!"</p>

<hr />

<blockquote><p>
"A number of motor-cars, including one
belonging to Mr. Lloyd George, are blocked

<p>However, they can sleep soundly in
their beds now, for he is back in London
again.</p>

<p>"You must read <i>Dash</i>," said B.</p>

simply peg away till you've finished it.
It's marvellous."</p>

<p>"I suppose you've read Darnock's
<i>Dash</i>?" said D. "It's by far his best
thing."</p>

<p>At dinner my partner on each side
gurglingly wished to know how I liked

it more or less by heart.</p>

<p>So having read some of Darnock's
earlier work and thought it good, I
acquired a copy of <i>Dash</i> and settled
down to it.</p>

<p>I had not read more than two pages
when it occurred to me that I ought
to know what the other books in the
library parcel were; so I went to look
at them. One was a series of episodes
in the career of a wonderful blind
policeman who, in spite of his infirmity,
performed prodigies of tact on point
duty, and by the time I had finished
glancing through this it was bed-time.
I put <i>Dash</i> under my arm, for I always
read for half-an-hour or so in bed. How
it happened I cannot imagine, but when
I picked up the book and began to
read I found, much to my surprise, that
it was the other library novel.</p>

<p>"Have you begun <i>Dash</i> yet?" B.
asked me at lunch.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, rather," I said.</p>

<p>"I envy you," he replied. "How
far have you got?"</p>

<p>"Not very far yet," I said.</p>

<p>"It's fine, isn't it?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"Fine."</p>

<p>The next evening I had just taken
up <i>Dash</i> again when I remembered
that that other novel must be finished
if it was to be changed on the morrow,
so I turned dutifully to that instead.
It was a capital story about a criminal
who murdered people in an absolutely
undetectable way by lending them a
poisoned pencil which would not mark
until the point was moistened. I enjoyed
it thoroughly.</p>

<p>The next evening I was getting on
famously with the fifth page of <i>Dash</i>
when the library parcel again arrived,
containing two new books for those I
had returned in the morning.</p>

<p>Meeting C. the next day he asked
me if I did not think <i>Dash</i> the finest
thing I had ever read.</p>

<p>I said yes, but asked him if he had
not found it a little difficult to get into.</p>

<p>"Possibly," he said, "possibly. But
what a reward!"</p>

<p>"You like books all in long conversations?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"I love <i>Dash</i>," he said, "anyway."</p>

<p>"Did you read every word?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, not perhaps every word," he
replied, "but I got the sense of every
page. I read like that, you know&mdash;synthetically."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," I said.</p>

<p>The next day I changed the two
library books that were finished for
two more, but it was <i>Dash</i> which I
took up first. There is no doubt about
its being a very remarkable book, but
I had had a rather heavy day and
my brain was not at its best. What
extraordinary novels people do write
nowadays! Fancy making a whole
book, as the author of <i>Hot Maraschino</i>
has done, out of the Elberfeldt talking
horses! In this book, which has an
excellent murder in a stable in it, the
criminal is given away by a horse who
tells her master (it is a mare) what she
saw. I couldn't lay the story down.</p>

<p>That night I dined out and heard more
about <i>Dash</i>. In fact, I myself started
one long conversation on that topic
with an idle lady who really had read
every word. I went on to recommend
it right and left.  "You
must read <i>Dash</i>," I said
at intervals; "it's extraordinarily
good."</p>

<p>"Some one was telling
me he couldn't get on
with it at all," said one
of my partners.</p>

<p>"Not really?" I said,
and clicked my tongue
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, he says it's so
involved and rambling."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," I said,
"one must persevere.
Books mustn't be too
easy. For my part&mdash;&mdash;Yes,
champagne, please."</p>

<p>"I'll get it, anyway,"
she said. "I feel sure
your judgment is sound."</p>

<p>Looking in at the club
later I found D. playing snooker. After
missing an easy shot he turned the talk
to <i>Dash</i>.</p>

<p>"Tip-top, isn't it?" he said.</p>

<p>"Which is your favourite chapter?"
I asked.</p>

<p>His face told me I had him.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that's difficult to say," he
replied.</p>

<p>"Surely you think that one about
the stevedore's spaniel, towards the
end, is terrific?" I said.</p>

<p>"Of course that's fine," he replied,
"but I was just wondering whether&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But I didn't stop to listen. There
is no stevedore and no spaniel in the
whole book, as I had carefully ascertained.</p>

<p>The next day I had A., B. and C.
with the same device.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I am plodding away with
<i>Dash</i>. I have now reached page 27.
A great book, as all agree. But the
books that I shall read while I am
reading it will make a most interesting
list.</p>

<h2>A HARD CASE.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;As the friend of
my family from 1846, I ask you for
advice on a subject which touches me
painfully both as a husband and a
father. My wife is, as I personally
know, the dearest woman in Great
Britain, and our child is, I am credibly
informed, the finest child in Europe.
<i>Infandum renovare dolorem.</i></p>

<p>Our child is four months old; it is
named Eunice. Yesterday I found my
dear wife with the infant weeping
piteously&mdash;my wife, that is, not the infant.
I proceeded at once to use all the
means in my power to soothe her and
to ascertain the reason of her unhappy
state. But it was only after a considerable
time and the expenditure of no
little ingenuity on my part that she
revealed the secret.</p>

<p>"I knew how it would be, John," she
said between her sobs, "I knew from
the first. I felt sure that, when baby
came you wouldn't care for her. And&mdash;and
you <i>don't</i>."</p>

<p>I at once took the child in my arms
and guggled to it. The child, I am
happy to tell you, Sir, responded at once
to my paternal attention and guggled
happily in reply. I felt patriotic pride
in the part I had taken in adding to the
womanhood of my beloved country.</p>

<p>A few days later I found my wife
sobbing violently. Carrying the child
with me&mdash;it was still guggling&mdash;I
crossed to her and again used my best
endeavours, not only in consolation, but
to ascertain the cause of her fresh unhappiness.
Again it was long before I
obtained a reply. But at last she said:
"I knew how it would be, John," her
sobbing was as violent as before, "I
knew from the first. I felt sure that
when baby came you would only care
for her and neglect me."</p>

<p>Now, Sir, what shall I do?</p>

<p>Your inquiring admirer,</p>

<p><span class="sc">Matthew Haile</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;My wife is sobbing again as I
write. I have at last ascertained her
trouble. It is that I don't care for the
baby.</p>

<h2>ORANGES AND LEMONS.</h2>

<h3>II.&mdash;<span class="sc">On the way</span>.</h3>

<p>"Toulon," announced Archie, as the
train came to a stop and gave out its
plaintive dying whistle. "Naval port
of our dear allies, the French. This
would interest Thomas."</p>

<p>"If he weren't asleep," I said.</p>

<p>"He'll be here directly," said
Simpson from the little table for two
on the other side of the gangway.
"I'm afraid he had a bad night. Here,
<i>gar&ccedil;on</i>&mdash;er&mdash;<i>donnez-moi du caf&eacute; et</i>&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"But
the waiter had slipped
past him again&mdash;the fifth time.</p>

<p>"Have some of ours," said Myra
kindly, holding out the pot.</p>

<p>"Thanks very much, Myra, but I
may as well wait for Thomas, and&mdash;<i>gar&ccedil;on,
du caf&eacute; pour</i>&mdash;I don't think
he'll be&mdash;<i>deux caf&eacute;s, gar&ccedil;on, s'il vous</i>&mdash;it's
going to be a lovely day."</p>

<p>Thomas came in quietly, sat down
opposite Simpson, and ordered breakfast.</p>

<p>"Samuel wants some too," said
Myra.</p>

<p>Thomas looked surprised, grunted
and ordered another breakfast.</p>

<p>"You see how easy it is," said
Archie. "Thomas, we're at Toulon,
where the <i>ententes cordiales</i> come from.
You ought to have been up long ago
taking notes for the Admiralty."</p>

<p>"I had a rotten night," said Thomas.
"Simpson fell out of bed in the middle
of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, poor Samuel!"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you gave
him the top berth!"  I asked in
surprise. "You must have known
he'd fall out."</p>

<p>"But Thomas dear, surely Samuel's
just falling-out-of-bed noise wouldn't
wake you up," said Myra. "I always
thought you slept so well."</p>

<p>"He tried to get back into <i>my</i> bed."</p>

<p>"I was a little dazed," explained
Simpson hastily, "and I hadn't got my
spectacles."</p>

<p>"Still you ought to have been able
to see Thomas there."</p>

<p>"Of course I did see him as soon as
I got in, and then I remembered I was
up above. So I climbed up."</p>

<p>"It must be rather difficult climbing
up at night," thought Dahlia.</p>

<p>"Not if you get a good take-off,
Dahlia," said Simpson earnestly.</p>

<p>"Simpson got a good one off my
face," explained Thomas.</p>

<p>"My dear old chap, I was frightfully
sorry. I did come down at once and
tell you how sorry I was, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"You stepped back on to it," said
Thomas shortly, and he turned his
attention to the coffee.</p>

<p>Our table had finished breakfast.
Dahlia and Myra got up slowly, and
Archie and I filled our pipes and followed
them out.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll leave you to it," said
Archie to the other table. "Personally,
I think it's Thomas's turn to step on
Simpson. You ought to assert yourself,
Thomas, anyhow. Throw some jam at
him and then let bygones be bygones.
But don't be long, because there's a
good view coming."</p>

<p>The good view came, and then
another and another, and they merged
together and became one long moving
panorama of beauty. We stood in the
corridor and drank it in ... and at
intervals we said "Oh-h!" and "Oh,
I say!" and "Oh, I say, <i>really!</i>" And
there was one particular spot&mdash;I wish
I could remember where, so that it
might be marked by a suitable tablet&mdash;at
the sight of which Simpson was
overheard to say "<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" for
(probably) the first time in his life.</p>

<p>"You know, all these are olive trees,
you chaps," he said every five minutes.
"I wonder if there are any olives
growing on them?"</p>

<p>"Too early," said Archie. "It's the
sardine season now."</p>

<p>It was at Cannes that we saw the
first oranges.</p>

<p>"That does it," I said to Myra.
"We're really here. And look, there's
a lemon tree. Give me the oranges
and lemons and you can have all the
palms and the cactuses and the olives."</p>

<p>"Like polar bears in the arctic
region," said Myra.</p>

<p>I thought for a moment. Superficially
there is very little resemblance
between an orange and a polar bear.</p>

<p>"Like polar bears," I said hopefully.</p>

<p>"I mean," luckily she went on,
"polar bears do it for you in the polar
regions. You really know you're there
then. Give me the polar bears, I always
say, and you can keep the seals and the
walruses and the penguins. It's the
hall-mark."</p>

<p>"Eight. I knew you meant something.
In London," I went on, "it
is raining. Looking out of my window
I see a lamp-post (not in flower) beneath
a low grey sky. Here we see
oranges against a blue sky a million
miles deep. What a blend! Myra,
let's go to a fancy-dress ball when we
got back. You go as an orange and
I'll go as a very blue, blue sky, and
you shall lean against me."</p>

<p>"And we'll dance the tangerine,"
said Myra.</p>

<p>But now observe us approaching
Monte Carlo. For an hour past Simpson
has been collecting his belongings.
Two bags, two coats, a camera, a rug,
Thomas, golf-clubs, books&mdash;his compartment
is full of things which have
to be kept under his eye lest they
should evade him at the last moment.
As the train leaves Monaco his excitement
is intense.</p>

<p>"I think, old chap," he says to
Thomas, "I'll wear the coats after
all."</p>

<p>"And the bags," says Thomas, "and
then you'll have a suit."</p>

<p>Simpson puts on the two coats and
appears very big and hot.</p>

<p>"I'd better have my hands free," he
says, and straps the camera and the
golf clubs on to himself. "Then if you
nip out and get a porter I can hand the
bags out to him through the window."</p>

<p>"All right," says Thomas. He is
deep in his book and looks as if he were
settled in his corner of the carriage for
the day.</p>

<p>The train stops. There is bustle,
noise, confusion. Thomas in some
magical way has disappeared. A porter
appears at the open window and speaks
voluble French to Simpson. Simpson
looks round wildly for Thomas.
"Thomas!" he cries. "<i>Un moment</i>," he
says to the porter. "Thomas! <i>Mon ami,
il n'est pas</i>&mdash;&mdash;I say, Thomas, old
chap, where are you? <i>Attendez un moment.
Mon ami</i>&mdash;er&mdash;<i>reviendra</i>&mdash;&mdash;"He
is very hot. He is wearing, in
addition to what one doesn't mention,
an ordinary waistcoat, a woolly waist-coat
for steamer use, a tweed coat, an
aquascutum, an ulster, a camera and a
bag of golf clubs. The porter, with
many gesticulations, is still hurling
French at him.</p>

<p>It is too much for Simpson. He
puts his head out of the window and,
observing in the distance a figure of
such immense dignity that it can only
belong to the station-master, utters to
him across the hurly-burly a wild call
for help.</p>

(<i>The New Orange Free Stater.</i>)</p>

<p>[Mr. <span class="sc">William O'Brien</span> referred to Ulster
as the new "Orange" Free State, which has
just received official recognition.]</p></div>

<p>Entering while Questions were in
progress <span class="sc">Premier</span> was received with
rousing cheer. Renewed with fuller
force when he stood at the Table
to discharge his momentous task. That
the enthusiasm was largely testimony
to personal popularity and esteem appeared
from what followed. Weighed
down with gravity of responsibility, as
he unfolded his plan he found lacking
the inspiration of continuous outbursts
of cheering that usually punctuate
important speeches by Party leaders.</p>

<p>Radicals and Nationalists were prepared
to accept his concessions to
Ulster feeling; but they did not like
them. <span class="sc">Redmond's</span> declaration that the
<span class="sc">Premier</span> "has gone to the very extremest
limits of concession" drew from
Ministerialists a more strident cheer
than any accorded to their Leader as
he expounded his plan.</p>

<p>Consciousness of this significant luke-warmness
reacted upon <span class="sc">Premier</span>. He
spoke with unusual slowness, further
developing tendency of recent growth
to drop his voice at end of sentence.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bonner Law</span> studiously quiet in
manner, moderate in speech. Nevertheless,
perhaps therefore, made it
clear that <span class="sc">Premier's</span> overtures, unloved
by his followers, will not be welcomed
by Opposition. <span class="sc">Carson</span>, who had enthusiastic
reception from Unionists,
flashed forth epigram that put Ulster's
view in a phrase.</p>

<p>"We don't want sentence of death,"
he said, "with a stay of execution for
six years."</p>

<p>Circumstances provided <span class="sc">Tim Healy's</span>
opportunity. Seized it with both hands.
On behalf of Liberal Party, <span class="sc">Premier</span>
proposed the vivisection of Ireland.
<span class="sc">John Redmond</span> consented. Plan submitted
was that four counties of Ulster
might, if they pleased, be excluded
from operation of Home Rule Act for
period of six years.</p>

<p>"Would any sane Britisher," <span class="sc">Tim</span>
asked, "embark upon civil war for the
difference between six years and 666
years?" As he mentioned the Number
of the Beast <span class="sc">Tim</span> turned to regard the
Irish Leader perched in corner seat at
top of Gangway. "Why should not
the hon. gentleman give up that, as he
has given up everything else? The
remains of his principles ornament
every step of the Gangway."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Second Reading of
Home Rule Bill moved. Debate adjourned
for indefinite period.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Prospect of <span class="sc">Chancellor
of Exchequer</span> brought up at Bar by
<span class="sc">Randles</span> and <span class="sc">Cassel</span> attracted big
House in spite of trial opening in mid-dinner-hour.
As the quarters of an
hour sped benches continued to fill up
till, when <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> rose to offer
his defence (which speedily merged into
form of attack), there were fully live
hundred present.</p>

<p>Prisoner indicted on grounds of
repeated inaccuracy, particularly on
account of ineradicable tendency to
speak disrespectfully of dukes. Nothing
could be nicer than manner of
prosecuting counsel. They were there
to discharge a public duty as champions
of the truth, vindicators of desirable
habit of abstention from exaggeration.</p>

<p>"I am," said <span class="sc">Randles</span>, "not here
to be personally disagreeable to the
<span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>,
whom I have always found genial and
courteous."</p>

<p>As for the junior counsel, he was
affected almost to tears in prospect of
task jointly committed to him.</p>

<p>"I do not wish," he said in his opening
sentence, "to make anything I say
more offensive or unpleasant than&mdash;than
the necessities of the case warrant."</p>

<p>Ribald Radicals laughed loudly at
this way of putting it. With the more
sober-minded its ingenuousness had
favourable effect, maintained throughout
admirable speech.</p>

<p>No one enjoyed the affair more than
prisoner at the bar. Like his great
prototype, <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> is never so
happy as when, with back against wall,
he turns to face an attacking host.</p>

<p>"Reminds me of days that are no
more," said the <span class="sc">Member for Sark</span>,
looking on animated scene from modest
quarters on a back bench. "Feel thirty
years younger. Am transported as by
a magical Eastern carpet to times when
<span class="sc">Don Jos&eacute;</span> rushed about the country,
fluttering his Unauthorised Programme,
bearding barons in their dens, lashing
out at landlords, and unceremoniously
digging dukes in the ribs, what time
a pack of scandalised Tories barked
furiously at his heels. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>
is an able man, courageous to boot,
endowed with gift of turning out sentences
that dwell in the memory,
delighting some hearers, rankling in
hearts of others. After all, he is
but a replica, excellently done I admit,
of the greatest work of art in the way
of Parliamentary and political debate
known to this generation."</p>

<p>Even while <span class="sc">Sark</span> murmured his confidences
to his neighbour they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span>
pointed by dramatic turn in lively
speech. Among charges of inaccuracy
specially cited was <span class="sc">Lloyd George's</span>
description of the Highland clearances,
whereby, he asserted, "thousands of
people were driven from their holdings
by the exercise of the arbitrary power
of the landlord." "I will give you an
authority for that," he said, and proceeded
to read a passage of burning
eloquence, in which multitudes of hardworking,
God-fearing people were depicted
as driven from the land that had
belonged to their ancestors, their cottages
unroofed, themselves turned out
homeless and forlorn.</p>

<p>"Who said that?" scornfully inquired
an incautious Member seated
opposite.</p>

<p>Quick came the reply.
"The Right Honourable
Member for West Birmingham,"
the <span class="sc">Chancellor</span>
answered in blandest tones.</p>

<p>Followed up this neatly
inserted thrust by quoting
from Tory newspapers, platform
and Parliamentary
speeches what was said of
<span class="sc">Don Jos&eacute;</span> in those his unregenerate
days. Some of
them curiously identical
with those in use just now
for edification and reproof
of another public man.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Major <span class="sc">John

had his breath taken away at Question

of Parliamentary life, not yet
recovered from depression as he sits
below Gangway "thinking of the

of late displayed much industry in devising
abstruse conundrums designed to
bring to light dark places in working
of Insurance Act. In <span class="sc">Masterman's</span>
enforced and regretted absence, duty of
replying to this class of Question on
behalf of Minister undertaken by <span class="sc">Wedgwood
Benn</span>, whose sprightly though
always courteous replies greatly amuse
both sides.</p>

<p>To-day the Major fired off, as it wore
from a mitrailleuse, volley of minute
questions involving prolonged research
on part of Minister to whom they were
addressed. Before the smoke had quite
cleared away <span class="sc">Benn</span> rose, remarked, "I
assure the honourable and gallant gentleman
he is totally incorrect," and
resumed his seat.</p>

<p>The Major gasped. After devotion
of precious time to looking up material
for his conundrums, after skill and
labour bestowed in shaping them, was
this the result? Every hair on his
head bristled with indignation. His
voice choked with anger. His eye,
accustomed to survey other battlefields,
gleamed on the laughing faces that
confronted him. Unseemly merriment
increased as he attempted to put Supplementary
Questions, which got unaccountably
mixed up between Section
72 of the National Insurance Act, 1911,
and the provision of Insurance Regulations
(No. 2) (Scotland).</p>

<h2>A BOOK OF THE DAY.</h2>

<p><span class="sc"><i>The Life-Story of a Turnip.</i> By Ato
Mato</span>, F.R.V.S.  Illustrated in colour.
<span class="sc">Messrs. Tuber, Root and Co.</span>  Price 3<i>s.</i> net.</p>

<p>(Reviewed by A. D. Ryan, M.A.)</p>

<p>There have been autobiographical
studies of the animal world; why not
of the vegetable? This is a delightful
monograph, executed with consummate
skill and verisimilitude throughout.
The author, who holds the Professorship
of Cereal Metaphysics at the
University of Tokio, has devoted the
greater part of his life to the study of
the vegetable kingdom; and we need
hardly remind our readers of the exceedingly
interesting treatise, entitled
"The Psychology of the Cabbage,"
which appeared in a recent issue of
the <i>Carnifugal Quarterly</i>.</p>

<p>It is indeed time for a more scientific
treatment of vegeto-animal phenomenon;
and Mr. Mato is the pioneer of a
science which, we hope, will soon receive
the attention which it undoubtedly
deserves. The present volume is
in its way a masterpiece. The author
has successfully avoided treating his
subject from a too human point of
view, and we are paying him a very
high compliment when we say that
the more we study the work the more
we are impressed with what we may
best describe as the "vegetability" of
the writer's mind. The book is racy
of the soil; it is written in a charming
and convincing style, and bears the
stamp of imaginative originality.
An acquaintance
to whom we lent the book
admirably expresses the
impression we had formed
of it by saying that it
might have been written by
<span class="sc">Eustace</span> or <span class="sc">Hallie Miles</span>.
It is characterised throughout
by the lofty and
detached spirit in which
a cultured turnip would
view the troubled course
of mundane events. The
sentiments expressed on
such questions as Woman
Suffrage, Home Rule, <span class="sc">Lloyd
George's</span> land policy,
though inevitably Radical
in tendency, are admirably
sane and unbiassed. We
cannot do better, if we
would convey to our readers
some conception of the
general tone of the work,
than quote the opening
paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"I was born of humble but worthy parents,
but the first years" [weeks?] "of my existence
were embittered by the loss of both father and
mother. My father, who was then in the prime
of life, was torn one day from the bosom of his
family, tied up in a sack, and taken with
some two hundred fellow-sufferers to a slaughter-house,
where he was cruelly butchered.
Still more tragic was the end of my dear
mother. Like my father she was dragged
away from her native soil. She was then
hurled into an empty shed, where for many
days she languished, deprived of both food
and light. At last she was thrown into a
tumbril with some five hundred unfortunates,
carted to a neighbouring farm, thence deported
in strict captivity to <span class="sc">Covent Garden</span>,
and finally conveyed to the sumptuous household
of Mr. <span class="sc">Bernard Shaw</span>, who devoured
her in three gulps."
</p></blockquote>

<p>From this poignant passage the
reader may see for himself the profound
understanding which Mr. Mato
has brought to bear on his theme. We
commend this book to all lovers of
nature.</p>

<h2>THE CINEMA HABIT.</h2>

<p>The writer of "The Ideal Film Plot,"
which appeared in a recent issue of
<i>Punch</i>, has quoted an "authority"
(anonymous) for the approval of his
scenario. It is quite evident that this
"authority" (so-styled) must belong
to the plebeian ranks of the film-world.
It cannot reside in <i>our</i> suburb.</p>

<p>Our cinema theatre is, I venture to
state, of a far superior order, both as
to drama and as to morality. It is not
a mere lantern-hall, close and stuffy,
with twopenny and fourpenny seats
(half-price to children, and tea provided
free at <i>matin&eacute;e</i> performances), but a
white-and-gold Picturedrome, catering
to an exclusive class of patrons at sixpence
and a shilling, with neat attendants
in dove-grey who atomise scent
about the aisles, two palms, one at each
side of the proscenium (<i>real</i> palms), and,
in addition to a piano, a mustel organ
to accompany the pathetic passages in
the films. Moreover, the commissionaire
outside, whose medals prove that
he has seen service in the Charge of
the Light Brigade, the Black Hole of
Calcutta, and the Great Raid on the
House of Commons in 1910, is not one
of those blatant-voiced showmen who
clamour for patronage; he is a quiet
and dignified r&eacute;ceptionnaire, content to
rely on the fame and good repute of
his theatre. Sometimes evening dress
(from "The Laburnums," Meadowsweet
Avenue, who are on the Stock Exchange)
is to be seen in the more
expensive seats.</p>

<p>It is unquestionably a high-class
Picturedrome. True that the local
dentist, who is a stickler for correct
English, protests against the designation.
I have pointed out to him that
if a "Hippodrome" is a place where
one sees performing hippos, then surely
a place where one sees performing
pictures is correctly styled a "Picturedrome."</p>

<p>I am acquiring the cinema habit.</p>

<p>It is very restful. Each film is preceded
on the screen by a certificate
showing that its morality has been
guaranteed by Mr. <span class="sc">Redford</span>. I have
complete confidence in Mr. <span class="sc">Redford's</span>
sense of propriety. If, for instance, a
bedroom scene is shown and a lady
is about to change her gown, one's
advance blushes are needless. That
film will be arrested at the loosing of
the first hook or button. Virtue will
always be plainly triumphant and vice
as plainly vanquished. Even the minor
imperfections of character will be suitably
punished. When on the screen
we see Daisy, the flighty college girl,
borrowing without permission her
friend's hat, gown, shoes, necklace and
curls in order to make a fascinating
display before her young college man,
it is certain that she will be publicly
shamed by her friends and discredited
in the eyes of her lover whose affections
she seeks to win in this unmoral fashion.</p>

<p>On the screen we shall be sure to
meet many old friends. The young
American society nuts, in square-rigged
coats, spacious trousers, and knobbly
shoes, will buzz around the pretty girl
like flies around a honey-pot, clamouring
for the privilege of presenting her
with a twenty-dollar bouquet of
American Beauty roses. The bouquet
she accepts will be the hero's; and the
other nuts will then group themselves
in the background while she registers
a glad but demure smile full in the eye
of the camera.</p>

<p>The hero, however, loses his paternal
expectations in the maelstrom of Wall
Street. Throwing off his coat&mdash;literally,
because at the cinema we are left in no
doubt as to intentions&mdash;he resolves to
go "out West" and retrieve the family
fortunes.</p>

<p>Our old friends the cow-boys meet
him at the wooden shack which represents
the railway station at Waybackville,
registering great glee at the
prospect of hazing a tenderfoot. We
know full well that he will eventually
win their respect and high regard&mdash;probably
by foiling a dastardly plot on
the part of a Mexican half-breed&mdash;and
we are therefore in no anxiety of mind
when they raise the dust around his
feet with their six-shooters, toss him
in a blanket or entice him on to a
meek-looking, but in reality record-busting,
broncho.</p>

<p>In the middle of the drama we look
forward to the "chases," and we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg 216]</span>
never disappointed. Our pursued hero,
attired in the picturesque bandarilleros
of shaggy mohair and the open-throated
shirterino of the West, will race through
the tangled thickets of the picadoro-trees;
thunder down the crumbling
banks of amontillados so steep that
the camera probably gets a crick in
the neck looking up at him; ride the
foaming torrent with one hand clasping
the mane of his now tamed broncho,
and the other hand triggering his
shooting-iron; and eventually fall exhausted
from the horse at the very
doorstep of the ranch, one arm, pinged
by a dastardly rifle-bullet, dangling
helplessly by his side. (It is, by the
way, always the arm or shoulder; the
cinema never allows him to get it distressingly
in the leg or in the neck.)</p>

<p>In the ultimate, with the wounded
arm in a sling, he will tenderly embrace
the heroine through a hundred feet of
film, she meanwhile registering great
joy and trustfulness, until the scene
slowly darkens into blackness, and the
screen suddenly announces that the
next item on the programme will be
No. 7, Exclusive to the Picturedrome.</p>

<p>We are greatly favoured with "exclusives."
It may be possible that
other suburbs have these films, but it
must be second-hand, after we have
finished with them. The names of
the artistes who create the <i>r&oacute;les</i> are
announced on the screen: "<i>Captain
Jack Reckless</i>&mdash;Mr. Courcy van Highball,"
or it maybe "<i>Juliet</i>, Miss
Mamie Euffles." Or it is a film taken
at the local regatta or athletic sports,
and the actors in it include all the
notabilities of the district. We flock
to see how we (or our neighbours) look
on the screen, and enjoy a hearty laugh
when the scullers of "The Laburnums"
register a crab full in the eye of the
camera, or "The Oleanders" canoe
receives a plenteous backwash from a
river-steamer.</p>

<p>But the staple fare is drama&mdash;red-blooded
drama, where one is never in
doubt as to who is in love with whom,
and how much. Sometimes, to be
frank, there is a passing flirtation, due
to pique, between a wife and a third
party, leading to misunderstandings,
complications and blank despair on the
part of the husband; but as there is
always a "little one" somewhere in
the background, we are never anxious
as to the final outcome. It will end
with the husband embracing the repentant
(but stainless) wife, and at the
same time extending a manly hand of
reconciliation to the third party.</p>

<p>We also like the dying fiddler (with
visions) and the motor-car splurges&mdash;especially
the latter. In our daily life
we are plagued with motor-cars, cycle-cars
and motor-cycle side-cars, being
on a highroad from London town to
the country; but on the screen we
adore them.</p>

<p>The cinema is very restful. There
are no problems to vex the moral judgment;
no psychological doubts; no
anxieties. It will be "the mixture as
before," ending in the loving, lingering
kiss.</p>

<p>Say what you will of Mr. <span class="sc">Redford</span>,
he never deprives us of the kiss.</p>

<h2>WATER ON THE BRAIN.</h2>

<p>Some interesting revelations have
been published in <i>The Daily Mail</i> on
the tonic effect of the bath on our
greatest workers, notably stockbrokers,
novelists and actors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur Bourchier</span> declared that
he read plays in the bath and that the
best results were obtained by those
selected either in the bath or on a long
railway journey. "A man," he added,
"is always at his best in his bath."
Again, Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Garvice</span>, the
famous novelist, said that he always
felt intensely musical while having his
bath, though the ideas for his stories
came chiefly while he was shaving.</p>

<p>We are glad to be able to supplement
these revelations with some further
testimony from the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the world
of letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Clement Shorter</span>, in the course
of an interesting interview, spoke eloquently
on the daily renewal of the
bath. From the day when he first
became a Wet Bob at Eton he had
never wavered in his devotion to
matutinal and vespertinal ablutions.
In fact, his philosophy on this point
might be summed up in the quatrain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A bath in the morning</p>
<p>Is the bookman's adorning;</p>
<p>A bath at night</p>
<p>Is the bookman's delight.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>His ideal form of exercise was a ride in
a bath-chair, just as his favourite diet
was bath-chaps and bath-buns. For the
rest he found that the ideas of his best
pars came to him while he was using a
scrubbing-brush which had belonged to
Posh, <span class="sc">Edward FitzGerald's</span> boatman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Laurence Binyon</span>, the poet and
art critic, confessed that some of his
choicest lyrics had been composed when
he was using a loofah. But it must be
applied rhythmically, to the accompaniment
of a soft hissing sound such as
was affected by stable-hands when
grooming high-mettled steeds. Mr.
<span class="sc">Binyon</span> added that it was a curious
thing that while frequent references
abounded in the classics to drinking
from the Pierian spring, no mention
occurred of bathing in it. But the
divine afflatus no doubt worked differently
in different ages. <span class="sc">Diogenes</span> lived
in a tub, but there was no evidence
that he ever took one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Percy Fitzgerald</span>, in reply to
a request for his views on the subject,
said that he considered soap and water
to be an invaluable intellectual stimulant.
<span class="sc">Dickens</span> was a great believer in
it; so, too, was <i>Lady Macbeth</i> and the
famous Bishop <span class="sc">Wilberforce</span>, known
as "Soapy Sam" from his excessive
addiction to detergents. <span class="sc">Charles
Lever</span>, again, whom he knew intimately,
had a passion for washing
and, so he believed, started a soap
factory, which was still in existence.</p>

<p>The Baroness <span class="sc">Orczy</span> pointed out to
our representative that there was a
natural harmony between different
sorts of baths and different styles of
composition. For heroic romance, cold
baths were indispensable. For the
novel of sensation she recommended
champagne with a dash of ammoniated
quinine. Similarly with regard to the
use of soaps. Thus in any of her stories
in which royalty, played a prominent
part she found it impossible to dispense
with Old Brown Windsor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Max Beerbohm</span> contented himself
by cordially endorsing Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur
Bourchier's</span> statement that he was (if
ever) at his best in his bath.</p>

<p>Ralston came into the railway
carriage with a fountain-pen and a
huge sheet of official-looking paper.</p>

<p>"Pardon my intrusion," he said.
"This is a non-party business. I am
just getting a few signatures&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't apologise, Sir," interrupted
Baffin. "I am delighted to see a young
man like you working in such a cause.
Every loyal Englishman, unless blindly
ignorant or filled with Radical spite,
will be delighted to sign it."</p>

<p>Grabbing the fountain-pen he scribbled
the imposing signature, "James
Baffin, Hughenden, Tulse Hill."</p>

<p>"It doesn't involve any financial
responsibility?" enquired Macdougal
with a touch of national caution.</p>

<p>"Not in the least. You just sign,"
replied Ralston.</p>

<p>Down went the name of Luke Macdougal.</p>

<p>Wilcox had to have his attention
drawn to the petition because he pretended
to be absorbed in <i>The Times</i>&mdash;reading
it with the attachment of an
old subscriber, though we all knew he
had only taken it for two days.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Wilcox, "at the
present moment I could not think of
taking any active part in military
operations myself, but I am sure my
son-in-law&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are not supposed to do anything
but sign," said Ralston.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly, I'll be very
pleased to sign. My son-in-law is a
most determined young fellow and feels
most strongly on this point."</p>

<p>And Mr. Wilcox amiably offered up
his son-in-law as a vicarious sacrifice.</p>

<p>Dodham was a little dubious. "You
see I'm not a politician," he began.</p>

<p>"Politics have nothing to do with
it," said Ralston.</p>

<p>"No one, Sir, but an abject coward,"
broke in Baffin, "would shrink from
saving his country at such a critical
moment."</p>

<p>"Well," said Dodham, "one can't be
far wrong when non-party men like
<span class="sc">Kipling</span> and <span class="sc">George Alexander</span> are
signing. I think I shall be justified."</p>

<p>The name of J. Percival Dodham was
added to the list.</p>

<p>Ralston turned to me. "You will
sign, old man?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," I said. "Signed a
teetotal-pledge when I was six, and my
aunts have brought it up against me
ever since. Besides I haven't a father-in-law
to take my place."</p>

<p>We stopped at a station.</p>

<p>"I'm off," said Ralston; "got to
rake up more signatures."</p>

<p>Four men glared contemptuously at
me for the rest of the journey. I don't
know whether they regarded me as a
miserable Little Englander or a wicked
Big Irelander.</p>

<p>When we reached Ludgate Hill I
saw Ralston standing triumphantly on
the platform.</p>

<p>"Done well to-day?" I queried.</p>

<p>"Oceans of signatures."</p>

<p>I glanced over his shoulder and saw
that the printing on the outer sheet
began, "To the Manager, S. E. and
L. C. D. Railway Companies."</p>

<p>"What's he got to do with this
thing?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Everything," explained Ralston
amiably. "It's a petition to run the
8.42 ten minutes earlier. I can't get
to the office by 9.15 as it is."</p>

<p>"What," I cried, "have all your
miserable dupes been signing away ten
minutes of their breakfast time?"</p>

<p>Ralston winked at me. "I've just
got to go into a carriage and say it's
non-political and they jump to sign it.
Signing's a sort of habit nowadays.
Not my fault if they don't listen to
explanations."</p>

<p>My heart thrilled as I thought of what
the brave men would say who, under
the impression they were merely promising
their own or their relations'
blood, had tragically shortened their
breakfast hour. Talk of revolutions!
Look out for a revolution in the Tulse
Hill district when the 8.42 becomes
the 8.32!</p>

<h2>MR. BALFOUR: MIXED DOUBLE LIFE.</h2>

<h3>(From our Special Correspondent.)</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Nice</span>, <i>Monday</i>.</p>

<p>"I must confess that I felt somewhat
nervous," said Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour</span> after the
match, as he sipped a split sal-volatile
and cinnamon, "but not so nervous as
I was in the singles. But it was the
first time that I ever stood up to the
twin-screw service which Baron von
Stosch uses so cleverly, and once or
twice I was beaten by the swerve."
But his partner, the famous Basque
amateur, Mme. Jaur&eacute;guiberry,
was loud in his praises. "He
played like a statesman and a
diplomatist," she said. The
Grand Duke <span class="sc">Michael</span> was also
greatly impressed and made a
neat <i>mot</i>. "His fore-hand drives,"
he said, "were worthy of a driver
of a four-in-hand." Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour</span>,
it should be noted, wore brown
tennis shoes with rubber soles,
unlike Sir <span class="sc">Oliver Lodge</span>, who
always golfs in white buckskin
boots. His shirt was of some
soft material and was marked
with his name on a tape, "A. J.
<span class="sc">Balfour</span>. 6. 1913."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Details of the Game.</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour</span> started serving,
and the first two games fell to
him and his partner owing to a
certain wildness in the returns of
Princess Pongo, a Nigerian lady
of remarkable agility who has
only been playing tennis for the
last three months, as, owing to
the laws of the Hausa tribe,
mixed tennis is strictly forbidden
in Nigeria. The Princess was,
however, well backed up by her
partner, the Baron von Stosch, an
athletic Prussian with a powerful
smash, and after five games all
had been called the set fell to the ex-<span class="sc">Premier</span>
and his partner. In the second
set a regrettable incident occurred, a
ball skidding off Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour</span>'s
racquet into the eye of the Grand Duke
Uriel, who was acting as umpire. Mr.
<span class="sc">Balfour</span> was much upset by the <i>contretemps</i>,
and repeatedly sliced his drive
into the net, remarking, "Dear, dear,"
on two occasions.</p>

<p>The activity of the Princess Pongo,
who wore a tasteful <i>toque</i> surmounted
by a stuffed baby gorilla, was much
admired, and when the score was called
"one set all," the enthusiasm of the
bystanders knew no bounds. A slight
delay was caused by the arrival of a
telegram for Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour</span>, announcing
that, in view of the grave importance
of the present political situation, <i>The
Times</i> had been reduced to a penny.
This he perused with deep emotion.
On the resumption of the game, however,
the ex-<span class="sc">Premier</span> at once showed
himself to be in his best form. He
sclaffed several beauties past the Baron,
nonplussed the Nigerian princess by his
luscious lobs, and finished off the set
and match by a wonderful scoop-stroke
which died down like a poached egg.</p>

<p>Early in the set he gave a remarkable
proof of his detachment. Just as the
Princess was preparing to serve one
of her juiciest undercut strokes, the
tones of a soprano practising her scales
rang out from a neighbouring flat.
"Rather sharp, I think," said Mr.
<span class="sc">Balfour</span>, and the Princess, overcome
by the ready wit of the ex-<span class="sc">Premier</span>,
served four faults in quick succession.
At the conclusion of the game Mr.
<span class="sc">Balfour</span> wiped his face twice with his
handkerchief and signed his name in
the birthday books of several American
heiresses.</p>

<p>We understand that there is no truth
in the rumour that Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour</span> will
box five rounds with <span class="sc">Carpentier</span> at a
Charity Bazaar and Gymkhana next
Saturday, but hopes are entertained
that he will dance the Ta-tao with the
Princess Pongo, and enter for the
three-legged race with the Grand Duke
Uriel.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<h3>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. Henry Holiday's</span> <i>Reminiscences of my Life</i> (<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>)
will show you a kindly simple soul who had an
extraordinarily nice time, met all kinds of interesting folk,
and had a generous devotion to any number of unpopular
causes, such as Women's Suffrage, the futuristic socialism
of <span class="sc">Bellamy's</span> <i>Looking Backward</i>, Home Rule in Ireland,
healthy and artistic dress, good music, the abolition of war.
Whatever capacity of expression his successful and not
undistinguished career as a painter (amongst other things,
of <span class="sc">Beatrice</span> cutting <span class="sc">Dante</span> on the bridge), stained-glass
worker and mural decorator proves him to have had in his
proper medium, the gift of pointed literary expression and
appropriate selection seems to have been withheld from
him. But he has little reason to complain. Some, at least,
of his causes are appreciably nearer victory than when he
espoused them; we are even a little nearer looking backwards.
One small point in these discursive memoirs will
especially delight the mildly cynical&mdash;that this worthy pre-Raphaelite,
who with his friends had suffered so much from
the limitations of view of a mid-Victorian Royal Academy,
should be so maliciously ready to have all modern rebels in
paint, their milestones hung about their necks, sunk in the
nethermost deeps with all their works! One can find
diversion, too, in the decorous story of Mr. <span class="sc">Holiday's</span> nude
statue of <i>Sleep</i>, rejected (according to a message from G. F.
<span class="sc">Watts</span>) on account of its nudity in 1879 by that same
Academy, and accepted in 1880 when the artist with
laborious modesty had modelled for it a plaster-of-paris
nightgown. The author claims some share, through the
Healthy and Artistic Dress Union, in the changes towards
rational beauty which women's dress has lately shown.
And that surely, is by no means to have lived in vain!</p>

<hr />

<p>There are few Memsahibs who know India and can write
about it as well as Mrs. <span class="sc">Alice Perrin</span>, so that when she
calls her new book <i>The Happy Hunting Ground</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>)
she sets you thinking. And when you begin to think, you
see that that really is the meaning of those tearful farewells
at Victoria and Charing Cross, that heavy-hearted cheering
and waving of handkerchiefs as the liner puts off from the
docks, which are for us who stay at home the symbol of
our share in the burden of empire. When our sisters and
our daughters (and our cousins and aunts) sail away to
Marseilles and the East they go to find husbands, largely
because for many of them there is in this country little
prospect of marriage with men of their own class. But
that is only half the story. They go in search of mates.
They stay to play, as helpmeets, the woman's part in
carrying on the high tradition of the British Raj. With this
fundamental truth as her background, Mrs. <span class="sc">Perrin</span> has
drawn, simply but with practised skill, the picture of a young
girl who leaves the dull security of Earl's Court to go a-hunting
in the plains and the hills, obedient to the call of India,
which is in her bones. There, like many another before
her, she loves and suffers, and makes sacrifices and mistakes,
and (I am glad to say) finds happiness at the last. The
strength of Mrs. <span class="sc">Perrin's</span> book, apart from the value of its
background, lies in the reality of its characters. If you
have a drop of Anglo-Indian blood in your veins you will
know what it means. You will greet them as blood
relations, and take a kinsman's interest not only in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span>
joys and sorrows, but in their whole attitude towards life,
and even their little tricks of thought and speech.</p>

<hr />

<p>About a year ago Mr. <span class="sc">Joseph Knowles</span> began to think
that "the people of the present day were sadly neglecting
the details of the great book of nature," and asked himself
if he could not do something to remedy matters. His
answer to this question was to take off all his clothes, and,
on August 4, 1913, to enter the wilderness of Northern
Maine, and live like a primitive man for two months. On
page 12 of <i>Alone in the Wilderness</i> (<span class="sc">Longmans</span>) he is to be
seen taking off his coat (and posing, I feel bound to add,
very becomingly), and eight pages farther on you can see
him divested of his clothing and "breaking the last link."
As used to enforce a primitive ideal, the modern art of
photography seems, if I may say so, a little out of this
picture; but, anyhow, into the forest Mr. <span class="sc">Knowles</span> went
with "nodings on," and there he stuck out his time, speaking
to no one, scarcely seeing a human being, and proving&mdash;well,
I don't honestly think that he proved much. But at least
he was not what he calls
a quitter, and as more than
once he had an intense desire
to return to civilisation,
he deserves much credit for
carrying out his resolution.
But, difficult as he found
it to remain for the two
months, he has found even
greater difficulty in writing
interestingly about his experiment.
Apart from his
account of a great moose-fight,
the fascinating scenes
in his book are those in
which his former experiences
as a trapper and
hunter are described. But
Mr. <span class="sc">Knowles</span> has not finished
with his adventure;
he is going to live stark-naked
in the wilderness for
another two months, but
this time under inspection,
so that the unbelievers can be convinced. I am not among
the unbelievers&mdash;indeed, I am convinced of the absolute
truth of every statement he makes&mdash;but I doubt if a repetition
of his performance is the best way to help on the
College of Nature which he hopes to start. Why, in short,
pander to the unbelievers?</p>

<hr />

<p>A period so bygone as that of His late Majesty <span class="sc">King
Henry II.</span> (of whose exact date you will scarcely need to
be reminded) has not an immediate and irresistible attraction
for every novel reader, and it may take much to persuade
some that they will ever become really concerned with the
deeds and destinies of such people as <i>Jehane</i> the woodward's
daughter, <i>Edwy</i> the tanner of Clee, and <i>Lord
Lambert do Fort-Castel</i>, be their deeds and destinies never
so adventurous or romantic. Further, the juvenile manner
of the pictorial cover attached to <i>Jehane of the Forest</i>
(<span class="sc">Melrose</span>) is not calculated to whet the appetite of the
adult public, and the eulogy of a well-known author,
appended on a printed slip, lacks the essential glow of the
effective advertisement. It misses the point; it is pedantic,
and pedantry is the one thing for which wary readers are
on the look out in stories of antiquity. It is first important,
then, to acquit Mr. L. A. <span class="sc">Talbot</span> of every offence of which,
in the blackness of the outward circumstances, he might be
suspected&mdash;affectations, anachronisms, excess of local and
contemporary colour, absence of humour or human touches,
any tendency to bore. The book presents a charming
picture of the counties on the Welsh Border and unravels
a delightful tale in which the characters talk the language
peculiar to their time, but are controlled by the everlasting
motives of human nature. Though the times were harder
than ours the people seem to have been neither better nor
worse than we are; and, when approached from such a
point of view as Mr. <span class="sc">Talbot</span> has taken, there is nothing to
be said against, but very much to be said for, the period of
1154-1189, which, as every schoolboy is punished for not
knowing, covers the reign of <span class="sc">Henry II.</span></p>

<hr />

<p>Miss <span class="sc">Mills Young</span> does not, I think, improve as an
artist. <i>The Purple Mists</i> (<span class="sc">Lane</span>) is her latest book,
and it is not so real and satisfactory a piece of work
as <i>Grit Lawless</i> or <i>Atonement</i>. The theme of her new
novel is the coming of love to two people who married
without any other emotion than restrained but unmistakable
antipathy. Why people
should do these things so
often in novels I do not
know, but on the present
occasion <i>Euretta</i> (<i>Euretta</i>
is not an attractive name)
and <i>John Shaw</i> (you can
tell by <i>his</i> name that he is
a strong silent man who is
deep in his work and has no
time to bother about women)
are driven into matrimony
by Miss <span class="sc">Mills Young</span>.
After a while it appears
that <i>Mr. Shaw</i> is beginning
to care for <i>Euretta</i> very
much, but he shows his
affection for her by avoiding
her as much as possible
and snarling when she
speaks to him. It is obvious
that a more kindly figure
must be somewhere close
at hand eager to console
<i>Euretta</i>. Miss <span class="sc">Young</span> discovers him, finds that he is precisely
the deep-drinking, warm-hearted rascal necessary for
this kind of occasion, and provides him with the inevitable
situations proper to the <i>tertium quid</i>. The defects of <i>The
Purple Mists</i> all arise from the fact that Miss <span class="sc">Mills Young</span>
has been told by her friends that she tells a good story.
If, next time, she thinks first of her characters and then
chronicles their logical development, instead of forcing them
into a threadbare plot, she will give us the fine book of
which I am sure she is capable.</p>
